# Dash Button Changed from F to Space

## Changes Made

### 1. Input System Actions File
**File**: `Assets/TopDownEngine/Common/ScriptsInputSystem/InputActions/TopDownEngineInputActions.inputactions`
- **Line 254**: Changed dash keyboard binding from `<Keyboard>/f` to `<Keyboard>/space`

### 2. Input System Generated Code
**File**: `Assets/TopDownEngine/Common/ScriptsInputSystem/InputActions/TopDownEngineInputActions.cs`
- **Line 269**: Updated generated code to match the input actions file

### 3. Legacy Input Manager
**File**: `ProjectSettings/InputManager.asset`
- **Player1_Dash**: Changed `positiveButton` from `f` to `space`

## What This Means

### For Players
- **Space key** now triggers dash
- **F key** no longer triggers dash
- All other dash functionality remains the same

### For Development
- Both Input System and Legacy Input Manager are updated
- Changes are consistent across all input systems
- No code changes needed - only input binding changes

## Testing

### How to Test
1. **Enter Play Mode**
2. **Press Space** - Character should dash
3. **Press F** - Character should NOT dash
4. **Test dash functionality** - Cooldown, distance, etc. should work as before

### Expected Results
- ✅ Space triggers dash
- ✅ F does not trigger dash
- ✅ Dash cooldown works
- ✅ Dash distance and effects work
- ✅ All dash modes work (MainMovement, Fixed, etc.)

## Notes

- **Input System Priority**: The project uses Unity's new Input System, so the `.inputactions` file is the primary source
- **Legacy Support**: Legacy Input Manager is also updated for compatibility
- **Auto-Generated Code**: The `.cs` file is auto-generated, but updated to match the source
- **No Script Changes**: Only input bindings changed, no code modifications needed

## Reverting Changes

If you need to change back to F:
1. Change `<Keyboard>/space` back to `<Keyboard>/f` in `.inputactions` file
2. Change `positiveButton: space` back to `positiveButton: f` in `InputManager.asset`
3. Regenerate the Input System code if needed
