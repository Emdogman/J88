# Player Sprite Jitter Fix

## Problem Fixed
The player sprite was jittering/shaking rapidly during movement due to timing conflicts between rotation and physics updates.

## Root Cause
- **Update/FixedUpdate Mismatch**: Rotation was applied in `ProcessAbility()` (Update - variable framerate) while movement was applied in `FixedUpdate()` (fixed 50Hz)
- **Timing Conflict**: Rotation and movement updates were out of sync, causing visual stuttering
- **Instant Rotation**: `rotationSpeed = 0` caused immediate rotation changes that conflicted with smooth movement

## Solution Applied

### 1. Moved Rotation to LateUpdate
- **Before**: Rotation applied in `ProcessAbility()` (Update)
- **After**: Rotation applied in `LateUpdate()` (runs after all Update and FixedUpdate calls)
- **Result**: Rotation now happens AFTER all movement physics are complete

### 2. Added Smoothing
- **Before**: `rotationSpeed = 0` (instant rotation)
- **After**: `rotationSpeed = 5` (slight smoothing)
- **Result**: Eliminates micro-jitter while maintaining responsiveness

### 3. Preserved Debug Functionality
- Mouse movement tracking still works for debug purposes
- Debug logs still show rotation information when enabled

## Technical Changes

### File: `PlayerMouseRotation.cs`

**ProcessAbility() Changes:**
```csharp
// OLD: Applied rotation every frame
ApplyRotation(targetAngle);

// NEW: Only tracks mouse movement for debug
// Rotation handled in LateUpdate()
```

**New LateUpdate() Method:**
```csharp
protected virtual void LateUpdate()
{
    if (!AbilityAuthorized || _camera == null) return;
    
    // Apply rotation AFTER all movement is complete
    Vector3 mouseWorldPosition = GetMouseWorldPosition();
    float targetAngle = CalculateRotationAngle(mouseWorldPosition);
    ApplyRotation(targetAngle);
}
```

## Benefits

### Visual Improvements
- **Smooth Rotation**: No more jittering or stuttering
- **Synchronized Movement**: Rotation and movement feel unified
- **Consistent Framerate**: Works smoothly at any framerate

### Performance
- **No Performance Impact**: LateUpdate is efficient
- **Maintained Responsiveness**: Still follows mouse cursor accurately
- **Stable Physics**: No interference with movement calculations

## Testing

### How to Test
1. **Enter Play Mode** and move the character in all directions
2. **Move mouse around** while character is moving
3. **Verify smooth rotation** without any jittering
4. **Test different movement patterns** (diagonal, quick direction changes)

### Expected Results
- ✅ Smooth sprite rotation while moving
- ✅ No visual jittering or stuttering  
- ✅ Character maintains proper facing direction toward mouse
- ✅ Movement and rotation feel synchronized

## Configuration

### Inspector Settings
- **Rotation Speed**: Now defaults to 5 (was 0)
  - **0**: Instant rotation (may cause jitter)
  - **5**: Smooth rotation (recommended)
  - **10-15**: Very smooth rotation (slower response)
  - **20**: Very slow rotation (not recommended)

### Fine-tuning
If you still experience issues:
- **Increase rotationSpeed** to 10-15 for more smoothing
- **Decrease rotationSpeed** to 2-3 for faster response
- **Set to 0** only if you need instant rotation (may reintroduce jitter)

## Notes

- **LateUpdate Timing**: Runs after all Update and FixedUpdate calls
- **Physics Sync**: Rotation now properly syncs with physics updates
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Debug Friendly**: Debug information still available when enabled
